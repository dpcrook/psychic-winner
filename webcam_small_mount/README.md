The webcam overhead stand that came with RoboGrok kit has a small stub where you are supposed to mount the included webcam. On mine, it didn't accept my webcam and ultimately this stub snapped off flush with the overhead cross-bar.

This project is intended as a replacement. It comes with wings that masking tape could be used to attach to crossbar (after having been screwed into webcam with the screw that came with its plastic attachment plug).
