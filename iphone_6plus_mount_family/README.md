# Bicycle and Car iPhone 6 Plus Mount family

I wanted a case + mount for my iPhone 6 Plus on my bicycle. A lot of the models on Thingiverse are for different cases or caseless iPhone dimensions.  I made this model to work with the case I use: "Incipio NGP Case for iPhone 6+".

As part of solving this problem, I first used OpenSCAD to model the dimensions on the case.  Then I iterated using experimental prints until I got to sizing and access holes I was satisifed with.

# TODO

 1. Create vent/louver based mount for my car
 1. Maybe try to make customizer(s) for Thingiverse
